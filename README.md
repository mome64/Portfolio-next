This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Email Setup

To enable the contact form functionality, you need to:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add your email credentials:
   ```
   CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   CONTACT_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```
3. For Gmail, you'll need to use an App Password instead of your regular password:
   - Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
   - Generate an App Password specifically for this application
   - Use the App Password as the `CONTACT_EMAIL_PASSWORD` value

Note: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control as it contains sensitive information.
